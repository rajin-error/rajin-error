👋 Hi, I’m @rajin-error , just a beginner trying to make sense of all these lines of code.
👀 I’m interested in writing code that hopefully works and learning from the countless mistakes I make.
🌱 I’m currently learning how to code without causing too much chaos.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where we can make things work, even if it means trial and error.
📫 How to reach me: Drop a message and I’ll get back to you unless I’m debugging… oops, I’m not a debugger.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him, but "The Code Learner" works too.
⚡ Fun fact: I once ran a script that did absolutely nothing. But at least I learned something!
